### Goal
Predicting Diabetes in Patients: Finding the Most Suitable Model

### Steps

Imported and cleaned the data sets, analyzed and visualized the relationships between the different variables, handled missing values and outliers, and performed feature engineering as needed.<br>

Two machine learning models was selected to predict diabeties.  Appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC) were used to check and compare models performance.<br>

### Conclusion

The Decision Tree model appears to perform slightly better across multiple metrics.Thought the fact that Precision for SMV model is better 0.69 VS 0.66 which is important part for deseace prediction. I would prefer to chose SMV model as the correct prediction of decease is our prioroty.

### Files in repo
diabetes.csv - dataset consisting of patients' medical data and whether they have diabetes or not.<br>
